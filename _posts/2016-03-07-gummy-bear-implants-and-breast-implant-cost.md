Lots of women have heard the term "gummy bear" breast implants.  Google estimates that the term is searched for nearly 10,000 times per month.  A recent survey by [RealSelf.com][0] showed that although 70% of women have heard of gummy bear implants, most were unsure exactly what it means.  If you're considering [breast augmentation][1], read on for the 5 things you need to know about these implants.

1\. **Different Types Of Implants Can Be Called Gummy Bears.**

The term simply means that the silicone gel inside the implant is very thick (also called cohesive).  If these implants were to rupture, the shell simply cracks and the implant doesn't change shape.  All silicone implants in use today are cohesive, so the term gummy bear really just means the thickest of the thick.

2\. **The Thicker Gel Holds The Implant Shape Better.**

Teardrop shaped implants have been around for a while but their popularity was limited because they tended to lose their shape over time.  Modern shaped implants with thick silicone gel keeps the same shape over time, so a shaped implant will resist becoming round as the years go by.

3\. **The Chance of Rippling Is Less With Gummy Bear Implants.**

****The thick gel inside these implants supports the outer shell, so the chance of seeing or feeling ripples in the surface of the implant is minimized.  This may be important for women with very little of their own breast tissue available to cover the implant.

4\.**They May Add To [Breast Augmentation Cost][2].**

Typically, shaped gummy bear  implants are more expensive than softer, round implants.

5\. **They Are Not Right For Every Patient.**

Not every patient wants or would benefit from a shaped implant as opposed to a round implant.  For example, most patients who want a lot of upper pole fullness would be happier with a round implant.  The gummy bear gel also tends to be firmer, which may feel less natural than the softer gel found in round implants.

****

I hope that helps clear up the confusion about these breast implants.  The good news is that when you come in for an appointment, you can see and feel the different types of silicone and saline implants and we'll use imaging technology to show you what your postop results can look like.  You and I together will decide what kind of implant is right for you
